**About The GLAA**
 At the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), we provide exceptional service to the public, businesses, and workers in the fight to stop worker exploitation.

* Enforcement \\- We investigate allegations of worker abuse under the Modern Slavery Act 2015\\. GLAA Officers conduct civil and criminal investigations and take enforcement action, including prosecutions and court orders to disrupt criminal activity.

**Things you need to know**
 The Government’s plan to Make Work Pay included a commitment to establish a single enforcement body to enforce workers’ rights, including strong powers to inspect workplaces and take action against exploitation. Bringing together state enforcement for workers’ rights will better support businesses who want to comply with the rules, create a strong, recognisable single brand so individuals know where to go for help, and lead to a more effective use of resources and coordinated enforcement action. Bringing state employment enforcement together will create a single executive agency of the Department for Business and Trade known as the Fair Work Agency (FWA). The FWA will bring together the enforcement bodies – HMRC’s National Minimum Wage enforcement function (HMRC NMW), the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate (EAS), the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) and the Director of Labour Markets (DLME) strategic functions.

This isn’t a back\\-office, report\\-only type of role. You’ll be building dashboards, creating data packs, leading benchmarking, owning data returns, and working closely with internal teams to shape performance measures that actually matter. And because you’re trusted as an expert, you’ll also have space to challenge, guide, and propose new ways of doing things.
 



  





 You’ll get to work with tools like SQL, Excel, Crystal Reports, and VBA to pull and shape data – but more importantly, you’ll help the organisation understand what that data means. Capability charts, performance insights, quality checks, and system improvements are all in your toolkit. You'll even lead workshops and occasionally step in for your manager, so your voice really will be heard.
 



 If you love the idea of data being used to solve real problems, and you enjoy building relationships as much as building reports, you’ll fit right in here.
 



  





 What you’ll need:
 


* Experience working with large datasets and relational databases
* Comfortable with tools like SQL, Excel, VBA, and ideally Crystal Reports or Business Objects
* Confident analysing performance, producing dashboards, and creating insight that people can act on
* Ability to influence and communicate clearly across all levels of the business
* A proactive mindset, someone who sees the story behind the numbers and wants to tell it



  





 What’s in it for you?
 


* A role where your work actually drives decisions, not just another report
* Space to improve systems, automate processes, and bring your ideas to the table
* A collaborative, down\\-to\\-earth culture that values insight and continuous improvement
* A business that’s big enough to be ambitious, but small enough that your impact will be seen
